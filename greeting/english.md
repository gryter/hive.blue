## About your keys:
- The "owner key" is only used for highly advanced purposes such as recovering a stolen account. It is similar to a master password in its importance.
- The "active key" is used to move your money. 
- The "posting key" is used to log in for posting and commenting. Use it on https://hive.blog,  https://peakd.com or any other Hive portal.
- The "memo key" is used for decrypting encrypted memos.

**If you accidentally reveal your private keys, please change them immediately. If you get hacked, you must let me know right away and I can recover your account under normal conditions.**

## Watch your transactions:
https://hiveblocks.com/@youraccountname This is the block explorer view that shows all of your transactions. It will also show you your public keys and other account settings.

## Posting and interacting:
- When you post or comment on Hive you get upvotes or downvotes, depending on whether others like or dislike what you're posting.
- Hive posts are rewarded based on quality and not quantity. Aim for thoughtful posts about something unique that you have to offer in order to get "curated". 
- It's important to always cite/reference everything included in a post that isn't created by you. This includes quotes from the internet, things that are paraphrased, and various images. 
- Your first post should ideally be an introduction. Tag it with #introduceyourself and any other tag you feel defines you.
- You can also join Communities that are on specific topics (but keep an eye out for their rules!) of interest to yourself and meet others through comments. Keep in mind that the number of followers you have on Hive doesn't directly translate to how much curation you receive. So don't stress and post quality content!
